# Example project for SNU bioinformatics class

## Spike-in sequence generator for small RNA sequencing

This program generates many random sequences following the
sequence profiles of human mature microRNA sequences.
It produces the final list of the sequences after filtering
out the potential matches to human, mouse, _Caenorhabditis elegans_, or
zebrafish microRNAs.
